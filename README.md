# Multiplayer Scenes and Avatar Control Using WebRTC

## 1. About This Project

This project aims to enhance the online multiplayer experience by integrating real-time communication and avatar control in virtual environments using WebRTC. It focuses on leveraging open web technologies to create immersive, interactive, and responsive multiplayer scenes, allowing users to control avatars in a seamless and efficient manner.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Communication:** Utilizes WebRTC for low-latency, peer-to-peer communication in multiplayer settings.
- **Avatar Control:** Enables precise control of avatars in the virtual space, synchronized with real-time user interactions.
- **Open Web Technologies:** Built on a foundation of open standards and technologies, ensuring broad accessibility and compatibility.

## 2. Project Goals

### Main Objectives

- **Develop Multiplayer Scenes:** Create interactive virtual environments where multiple users can interact in real-time.
- **Implement Avatar Control:** Establish a robust system for users to control their avatars using WebRTC data streams.
- **Ensure Compatibility:** Guarantee that the system works seamlessly across different devices and platforms, adhering to open web standards.

### Implementation Approach

- **WebRTC Integration:** Employ WebRTC for handling real-time data transfer, focusing on optimizing network performance and data synchronization.
- **Front-End Development:** Design and develop the user interface, prioritizing ease of use and responsiveness.
- **Back-End Infrastructure:** Set up a scalable and secure server infrastructure to manage connections and coordinate multiplayer interactions.

## 3. References to Open Web Technologies

This project is grounded in the use of open web technologies, ensuring transparency, accessibility, and interoperability. Key technologies include:

- **WebRTC:** A free, open project that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities.
- **WebXR:** An API that allows developers to create immersive VR and AR experiences on the web.
- **Three.js:** A JavaScript library that enables 3D graphics in a web browser without relying on proprietary plugins.
- **Node.js:** An open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine.
